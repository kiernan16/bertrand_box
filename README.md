Testing Bertrand's Box Paradox

From Wikipedia
There are three boxes:

a box containing two gold coins,
a box containing two silver coins,
a box containing one gold coin and one silver coin.
The 'paradox' is in the probability, after choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random, if that happens to be a gold coin, of the next coin drawn from the same box also being a gold coin.
